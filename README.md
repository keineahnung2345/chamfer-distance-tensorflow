# chamfer-distance-tensorflow
TensorFlow implementation of chamfer distance

This repo stores my answer in the two stackoverflow questions:

The first is : [Is it possible to build a custom loss function of chamfer distance using Keras](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54705569/is-it-possible-to-build-a-custom-loss-function-of-chamfer-distance-using-keras/54706262#54706262).

The second is : [Chamfer distance between two point clouds in tensorflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47060685/chamfer-distance-between-two-point-clouds-in-tensorflow/54767428#54767428).

So there are two versions.

In each version, there are both tensorflow implementation and numpy implementation for validation purpose.
